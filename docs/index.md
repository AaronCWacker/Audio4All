# About the Project:
Recent advances in digital music, fueled by the increasing computational abilities available to consumers, allow for musicians to create sounds encompassing all genres of music. This includes the synthesis of organic sounds as well as the reproduction of digitized acoustic instruments.

However, this rapid increase in digital music capabilities has led to several drawbacks in the consumer digital music industry. These include a dependence on the high-latency MIDI protocol as well as the need to purchase multiple pieces of equipment to create digital music effectively.

Audio4All addresses these issues by introducing a fully embedded digital music creation platform featuring low levels of input latency. Audio4All uses three popular single-board computers: Bela, Raspberry Pi, and Jetson Nano, interfaced with a custom digital music instrument (DIM), to demonstrate the possibility of such a system.
By incorporating a digital input controller, real-time low latency audio engine, digital audio workstation, and chord progression recommendation system into a single embedded environment, Audio4All aims to demonstrate that an embedded turnkey musical platform can be achieved and even improve on current issues in the digital music industry.
